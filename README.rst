==============================================

Linearize research papers/articles into readable ebooks.

About
-----------------------
This script (convert.sh) takes a pdf file, 
and tries to make it into a presentable ebook. 
This means text columns are not side-by-side any more, but moved to be one after another,
wide figures and tables are handled separately, and if necessary, rotated to fit the screen better.
A linearized html view and a epub file is created.

Limitations: This script renders the pdf to png files at high resolution, so that
all formulae and texts are presented correctly on the reader.
